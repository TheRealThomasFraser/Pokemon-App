<h1> Pokemon App </h1>

<h2> This project is Paused! ⏸️</h2>

<p> The app is functional, but could use a cleanup on the UI and some additional features. The code can most likely be improved and use some more comments, however I'm putting Swift on hold for now as i focus on other languages I'm more confident with in anticipation of returning to uni.  </p>

<h2> About 💬 </h2>

<p> This app is a personal project I started to continue learning swift and using APIS. I decided o using pokeAPI, which allowed me to get IDs, types, names and sprites of all the pokemon to create an app that generates random pokemon and has a complete pokedex. </p>

<h2> Usage 📊 </h2>

<ul> 
 <li> Generate a random pokemon </li>
 <li> View a pokemon's picture, name and types in the pokedex</li>
</ul>

<h2> Features 🗒️ </h2>

<ul>
 <li> Randomly generated pokemon </li>
  <li> A complete pokedex with sprites, names and types of each pokemon </li>
  <li> An understandable UI </li>
</ul>
